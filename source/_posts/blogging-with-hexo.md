Welcome to my new hexo blog!
============================

Yes, you might have seen, that it doesn't look new at all. Thats because I've imported all my old articles. I even managed to import my super old wordpress posts.

Actually, importing old stuff was quite easy. [Hexo](http://hexo.io/) supports migrator scripts and one for [Wordpress](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-migrator-wordpress) is already existing. Thanks to the simple structure of my old [self-made blog engine](https://github.com/nkoehring/SWS-Log) I was able to quickly hack an [migrator](https://github.com/nkoehring/hexo-migrator-swslog) for it, too.

I had to clean up alot, afterwards. The Wordpress blog has tags and categories.  SWSLog has only tags. Hexo has tree structured categories and tags. So I decided to use that to completely renew the mess of categories and tags to something (hopefully) well structured and meaningful.

I also build [my own hexo theme](https://github.com/nkoehring/hexo-theme). Feel free to use it.
