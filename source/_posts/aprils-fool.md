Someone was even offendedâ€¦ Sorry for that but it's april fools day.

I turned my blog into a flash driven image gallery where all blog articles (or rather some of them, because lazyness) became pictures. Yes, real pictures. I took screenshots of them.

Thanks to Lisa for indicating me, that the text became inselectable. I desisted from integrating an OCR into the viewer.
