…I cannot sleep. That&#8217;s what happens if you think to much about the badness in this world. Sometimes I wish I have no empathy at all. Must be a way easier life.

I&#8217;m finished with »Zahras Paradise«. It&#8217;s 1:34 AM now. What should I do? My head cannot switch off. Programming? Writing senseless stuff in my blog? I don&#8217;t know.

Good night. Maybe.
