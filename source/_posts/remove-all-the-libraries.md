All the things are evolved very much today. We have so much tools and frameworks to make the daily developers life easier, that a complete overview is quite impossible.

But here sticks the problem: Many developers overuse these tools and most probably cannot live without them anymore. This leads to in fact tiny projects grown huge just for the comfort of their developers.

### Comfort is not a bad thing!

Actually, there are some good reasons for developer comfort. Most important are of course speed and maintainability. But there are counter-examples. The android app of a quite popular todo list for example is about ten megabytes in size. But it&#8217;s still just a todo app. Alot of websites are filled up with tons of javascript libraries, using only some percent of their functionality. With Visual Studio vom Microsoft you can click a <span class="caps">RPC</span> connected client/server thing in minutes with just a couple lines of code written by yourself. The final application sizes a couple of megabytes but has the functionality of some tens of kilobytes.

### <span class="caps">REMOVE</span> <span class="caps">ALL</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">LIBRARIES</span>!

Rather not, of course. But rummage through your dependencies and look which ones you really need and how much of them. Maybe there is a minor enhancement in developers comfort which costs consumers a significant amount of memory or bandwidth. Maybe you can skip this monstrous <span class="caps">MVC</span> framework for your Javascript web project and just use a tiny set of tools combined for all the functionality you need. Be a developer who can handle frameworks and helpful tools <span class="caps">BUT</span> knows what&#8217;s behind the scenes. Don&#8217;t just stick together an app if you are not able to do it without the mighty <span class="caps">IDE</span>.

Of course, bandwidth, disk space and computing power are cheap these days. But if we forget how to build an application, we will not be able to innovate any further.
