One project I&#8217;m totally looking forward to is Neovim. Beeing totally in love with <span class="caps">VIM</span> as editor is one thing, but this love is not blind! <span class="caps">VIM</span> is now more than twenty years old, also supporting legacy systems is nice and all but lets face it: at least 95% of the users are not on an Amiga or <span class="caps">MSDOS</span> anymore.

Read the [fundraiser page](https://www.bountysource.com/fundraisers/539-neovim-first-iteration) for more information, if you are interested. [tarruda](http://tarruda.github.io) did a great job in explaining in every detail, what he plans to do, so it&#8217;s worth reading it.

The fundraiser reached its $10000 goal after less than 48 hours, by the way. Thats massive!
