So the Random Name Jam started and I got some names.

Curiously two of them had a dog inside and just today I met an awesome dog on my [favourite coffee place](https://www.here.com/deutschland/berlin/coffee-tea/bonanza-coffee-heroes--276u33dc-5ebd4871d9b64642a11270813bc3d449?msg=Bonanza%20Coffee%20Heroes&map=52.53996,13.40545,16,grey).

Anyway, I had following names to chose from:
  * Summer Puppy Armada
  * Tropical Dog Playhouse
  * National Lampoon's Karaoke DX

As the title already told you, I took the first one and will create a game with some cute puppies and loads of action! Or something like this. Lets see.

I also think about keeping the Ludum Dare tradition to create a time lapse video of the development.


Cheers!
