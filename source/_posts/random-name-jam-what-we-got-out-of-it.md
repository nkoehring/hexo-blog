Last week, the first [Random Name Jam](http://lnwdr.github.io/random-name-jam/) happened and some nice results came out of it. The website now links to the projects.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish [Summer Puppy Armada](http://koehr.in/spa/) but I'll try to do in the next weeks. You can try it anyway for some fancy ass puppies shooting the hell out of the water around them.
