I've got my Espruino Pico!
==========================

 [Gordon Williams a.k.a. Pur3](http://www.pur3.co.uk/) created the [Espruino](http://www.espruino.com/), an Arduino style microcontroller, preloaded by a Javascript interpreter. In October 2014, he started a [kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gfw/espruino-pico-javascript-on-a-usb-stick) to fund the [Espruino Pico](http://www.espruino.com/Pico): A microcontroller board on an USB stick.

And it is awesome!

They made it as simple as possible to program the little device. It is barely more than plug and play. With the [Espruino Web IDE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espruino-web-ide/bleoifhkdalbjfbobjackfdifdneehpo) you can start programming the Espruino right in your browser, even in a Scratch-like way if you want. But don't worry consoleros, there are tools for you, too!

I hope this project spreads even more. I see awesome projects coming!
