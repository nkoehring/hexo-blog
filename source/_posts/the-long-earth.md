I've read a book!
-----------------

Fascinating, isn't it?

Of course it's not. But it's been a while since a grabbed a book, started to read it and couldn't stop until I finished.

But, finally, it happened again. _The Long Earth_, written by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. I saw it, never heard of it, but totally had to buy it after seeing the authors.

I'll try not tell you too much about it: There is a long line of parallel worlds, each a bit different from the next one. Inbetween there are so called Joker Worlds, where something special and unique happened. Someone built a super simple machine to switch between these worlds and the adventure begins.

Of course there is way more, but read by yourself! It is absolutely worth it. If I would have to give a rating, I would give it the highest one.
