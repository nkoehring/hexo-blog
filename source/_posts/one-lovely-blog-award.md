Unbelievable. Someone wants me to join one of these blogging games. Most people would not get me this far, but this is something different. Because I like Frau Nett, I didn't say no. But I will do it in english because I once decided to completely switch to english in my blog.

*EDIT:* I added some more details to the list.

So what the…?
-------------

[Frau Nett](http://blog.frau-nett.de/?p=891) mentioned or rather nominated me to the _One Lovely Blog Award_. The rules say, I have to say thank you to the one who nominated you (but it seems, swear words are allowed, too), tell everyone seven things about myself and last but not least find seven poor bloggers and nominate them.
Thank you Frau Nett.

For the ones who skip continouus text (and therefor be completely wrong here) I list these rules again:

 * say thank you to the nominator (is that an actual word?)
 * list the rules
 * tell seven things about yourself
 * find seven new victims

Lets go:
--------

So now, seven things about my self:

1. I'm a programmer and hacker. The engine behind this blog is often more important for me than the actual content. I regularily visit the chaos communication congress (now in Hamburg) and I sometimes [publish source code](https://github.com/nkoehring). Also I'm coaching and I love to do it. You probably find me in some of the [RailsGirls Berlin](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/) workshops and at [JugendHackt](http://jugendhackt.de/).

2. I live in Berlin and I really like that dirty mix of artsy, hipsteroid multi-kulti. Initially I came here for work and of course because I was curious. Now, after a couple of years, I really love the city and all its rough edges.

3. I was raised in a small village despite the fact that I always wanted to live in a big city. It took only 16 years to get out of the village, but 24 to actually get into the big city. I sometimes visit my parents and my "home" rather became some kind of vacation place for me. It's very beautiful with its lake and nice old castle. But it also gets unbelievable boring if you live there.

4. I'm vegetarian with propensity to veganism. I mostly eat vegan at home and at least try it in the public. Working in an office , I often have lunch in some restaurant around, where it's hard to get vegan food. Now after four(?) years of beeing a vegetarian (a.k.a. I was vegetarian before it was cool) I really love how vegetarian and even vegan restaurants appear everywhere.  Especially in Berlin of course. I totally recommend [Fast Rabbit](https://www.facebook.com/fastrabbitfood) close to Mauerpark.

5. I rarely write blog articles (I bet you knew that) despite having tons of ideas. I'm just not routined enough. And my blog currently has an issue and shows you the wrong time of the last written article (oops). I will probably fix this problem and write one more article (see No7) and my blog goes to sleep again.

6. There is a better half in my life but she lives in Leipzig. She doesn't want to leave Leipzig and I can't (and partially won't) leave Berlin. Maybe, some day, we just leave Germany and start from scratch. Or we just kill each other. One or another.

7. I just read the book “The Long Earth”, written by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. And I loved it. 500 pages, took me three days. I will probably write about it, soon.


Now I have to find seven victims. Thats actually not easy but:
