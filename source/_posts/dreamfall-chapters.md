Now, after all that time waiting desperately for this one thing, it finally happened: The sequel to __The Longest Journey__ and __Dreamfall__ came out!

And I'm kind of afraid to play it.

“Why?”, you may ask. The critics are overwhelmingly positive and I also followed the whole way from the beginning of the [Kickstarter Campain](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redthread/dreamfall-chapters-the-longest-journey) to its release. It all looks terrific!

But it will be over at some point in the near future. After a few days of total addiction I will have to stop and get back to normal life. Way to often I'm doing this already. Not so much with games, but events. Visiting the annual [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/) or coaching at [JugendHackt](http://jugendhackt.de/) or [RailsGirls](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/), is always followed by a downswing.

I'm a masochist.
